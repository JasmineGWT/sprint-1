What is a command line?

A command line is a way of interacting with a computer program by typing out the commands. For example instead of clicking on a folder named "Pictures" and then clicking on another folder named "Cute cats" within "Pictures" you would type "cd cats" then "cd cute cats". Another would be instead of creating a new empty file named "test_atom.txt" within atom and then saving it in a folder named "Testing atom" you would use "cd" to get to the folder "Testing atom" then type "touch test_atom.txt"
